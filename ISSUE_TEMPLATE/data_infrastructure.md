## Implement The River: Data Infrastructure

This module handles data storage and configuration.

- **Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP)**: Database to store job listings, summaries, and categories. Tracks viewed jobs to avoid duplicates.
- **The Yssi-My-Ss-Ss**: Configuration file (YAML/JSON) for user settings, keywords, API keys, and platform specifics. Keeps private data separate from public code and enables easy configuration.
