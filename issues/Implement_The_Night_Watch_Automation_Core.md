# Implement The Night Watch: Automation Core

This is the core automation module responsible for discovering and analyzing job listings. It consists of:
- Here Comes Everybody (HCE): Ethical and polite job listing scraper for various freelance platforms.
- Shaun: Keyword-based filter using blacklist and whitelist to process job listings from HCE.
- The Mookse and the Gripes: LLM agent to summarize and categorize jobs filtered by Shaun (e.g., 'LLM Integration', 'Backend Bug Fix').
