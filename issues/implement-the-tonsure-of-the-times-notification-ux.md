## Implement The Tonsure of the Times: Notification & UX

### Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (HCE)
A notification engine that sends alerts to the user (email, Telegram, Slack, etc.) when new relevant job listings are found and categorized.

### The Washerwomen
A simple user interface (CLI or minimal web app) for reviewing job listings, summaries, and categories. It should allow marking jobs as 'viewed', 'ignored', or 'applied'.

### Design Considerations
The design should be modular to allow plugging in new notification channels or UI platforms easily.
